# Popular Movies - Stage 2

## Project Summary
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

## Stage 2: Trailers, Reviews, and Favorites


### User Experience

In this stage you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.

You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

- You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
- You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
